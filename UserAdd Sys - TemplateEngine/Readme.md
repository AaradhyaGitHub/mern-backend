# Pug Template Engine Demo

This is a very simple demo app that showcases how to use the **Pug** template engine with **Node.js** and **Express**.

## Description

The app demonstrates how to render dynamic data using Pug templates. It holds a hardcoded array of users inside `app.js`. When a `.get` request is made, Node and Express handle the request and pass the user data to the Pug template, which then displays it dynamically on the page.

## Tech Stack

- Node.js
- Express
- Pug (template engine)

## How to Run

1. Clone the repo or download the files.
2. Install dependencies:

   ```bash
   npm install
   ```
````

3. Run the server:

   ```bash
   node app.js
   ```

4. Visit `http://localhost:3000` in your browser.

## Notes

- This was a quick 20-minute exercise to practice using Pug with Express.
- The user data is not fetched from a databaseâ€”it's a static array in the backend.

```
